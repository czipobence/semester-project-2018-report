\section{Correctness Equivalence}

The goal of the previous translation was to be able to reason about the correctness of the original Stainless program, based on the provability of the Coq representation. We need that for every Stainless program $p$ we have.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item if a stainless program $p$ is valid, than $\tf(p)$ is also valid,
	\item if $\tf(p)$ is valid, than $p$ is also valid.
\end{enumerate}

contratdiction(p: False) : T := match p with
end.

assume t crashes
it takes a branch that leads to error
than the cq representation t' take some reduction branch to a state where
{} |- p: False (empty context implies p of type false)

Contradiction, because every correctly typed expression should evaluate to a value of that type and there is no value of type False

We assume that if a term b evaluate to true in stainless (b --*> true) than in coq t(b) --coq-> true
 

thus an if will chose that branch

Not so clear with params, e.g. functions
