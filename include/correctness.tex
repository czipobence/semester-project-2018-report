\section{Correctness Equivalence}

The goal of the previous translation was to be able to reason about the correctness of the original Stainless program, based on the provability of the Coq representation. We need that for every Stainless program $p$ we have.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item if a stainless program $p$ is valid, than $\tf(p)$ is also valid,
	\item if $\tf(p)$ is valid, than $p$ is also valid.
\end{enumerate}
